# 2023-Bootcamp

This repository will act as my hub for all things related to Dr. Angela Yu's course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.

About Me:

My name is Josh Scheerer and I currently reside in the beautiful city of Wilmington, NC.  In 2011 I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, focused in Web Development.  At the time, I was feeling burnt out from school and work, and decided to take a hiatus from the field to explore some other career paths.  During this time, I have worked mainly in the service industry with some gaps filled with sales jobs, and have learned a ton about myself and interpersonal relations.  Though I have seen a lot of success in these areas, my desire to get back to learning and creating has been reignited, and I'm glad to be working my way back into the scene.

I plan to complete lessons and push commits daily, and get myself where I need to be to realign my career path.  If you are following along with my journey, I hope you enjoy seeing my progress, and please don't hesitate to reach out!

Thanks,
Josh
