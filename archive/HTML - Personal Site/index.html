              <strong>Hi, I'm Josh!</strong> I am a full-stack web developer
              with a background in food service and various leadership
              positions. I continuously further my education through Udemy
              courses and personal research. In my spare time, I like to enjoy
              craft brews, hang out and exercise on the beach, and play tabletop
              games with my friends and family.

                Worked up the ladder from a server with little experience in the
                field to salaried manager in just over a year. Worked as a key
                manager for six months prior to getting the promotion in October
                2019.
              </li>
              <li>
                Managed labor percentages, profit and loss analysis, inventory,
                scheduling, onboarding, training, and proper handling of guest
                issues to ensure the success of the business and teammates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gained exposure to point of sale, inventory, and scheduling
                software, with a working knowledge of each and an understanding
                of how to transfer that knowledge to new platforms
              </li>
              <li>
                Practiced flexibility and multi-tasking through in-shift
                analysis of the flow of the restaurant, finding the weak point,
                and either transitioned myself into that position, or delegated
                tasks to others to relieve pressure
